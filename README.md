### Workshop for Bologna Students
Start with reading the slides in `Client-side_Data_Visualization.pptx` then have a look to the files referenced there and eventually tweak them as you like. 
There are many files in this repo that are not strictly related to the workshop, but nonetheless are there for your experiments.
